OpenCalais NER 
http://shujianbu.github.com/Open_Calais_NER/

===============

Brief: 
- This small project fetches five articles from both The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and analyzes the entities, topics, languages, relations, and etc. The tool I used is OpenCalais, which is a rapidly growing toolkit of capabilities that allow people to readily incorporate state-of-the-art semantic functionality within their blog, content management system, website or application. Google has pushed the state of the art in both NER and proposition extraction as part of their Knowledge Graph which extracts structured information from the entire web. 

Ideas:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Text Enrichment 
- Data Analysis 

Tools:
- Python 
- OpenCalais 
- HTML
